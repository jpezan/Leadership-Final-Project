# Leadership Final Project
Business Case Evaluation of Defaulting Algorithm for Planet Fitness 

## Planet Fitness

### About Company:
Planet Fitness is an American franchisor and operator of fitness centers based in Hampton, New 
Hampshire. With 2,039 clubs around, PF is one of the largest fitness club franchises by number 
of members and locations. It markets itself as a “Judgement Free Zone” that caters to novice 
and casual gym users. Outside the US, they have fitness centers other countries such as Canada, 
Dominican Republic, Panama and Mexico

### Business Problem:
Customer memberships are an integral part of Planet Fitness business. As the company 
continues to grow its base and build innovative services, it is important to also investigate 
customer attrition, in particular due to non-payment of dues. Few months ago, Planet Fitness 
gave out long-term membership offers to selective customers and has been keeping track of 
the ones who continue to make their payments and ones who end up defaulting. This possesses 
huge risk and the company would like to identify customers who fail to make payments ahead 
of time. Your team has been tasked to look at historical data of customers including age, 
gender, usage, months due, down payment, etc. and whether they defaulted or continue 
making payments and come up with a machine learning solution that can be used to predict 
future defaulting.
